## What is Kid Pix?

Kid Pix is a playful digital painting program that recreates the magic of the classic 1989 Kid Pix software. It's designed for creative expression with whimsical tools, sound effects, and delightful surprises. Whether you're 8 or 80, Kid Pix encourages experimentation and fun over precision.

## Getting Started

### Using Kid Pix Online

### Using Kid Pix Locally
1. Download or clone this repository
