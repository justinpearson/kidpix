## What is Kid Pix?

Kid Pix is a playful digital painting program that recreates the magic of the classic 1989 Kid Pix software. It's designed for creative expression with whimsical tools, sound effects, and delightful surprises. Whether you're 8 or 80, Kid Pix encourages experimentation and fun over precision.

## Getting Started

### Using Kid Pix Online

1. Open your web browser and go to [kidpix.app](https://kidpix.app)
2. The Kid Pix canvas will load automatically
3. Start clicking on tools and drawing!

### Using Kid Pix Locally

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173`
4. Kid Pix will load and you can start creating!

_Note: You need a web server because the app loads JavaScript modules and audio files that browsers block when opening files directly._
