## Brush Techniques

### Hold Shift for Larger Effects

- Most brushes become bigger when you hold Shift while drawing
- Try the same brush with and without Shift for variety

### Modifier Key Combinations

- Try holding **Alt**, **Ctrl**, or **Cmd** while drawing
- Different brushes respond to different modifier keys
- Some brushes change color, pattern, or behavior with modifiers

### Speed Effects

- Draw slowly for concentrated effects
- Draw quickly for lighter, more spread out patterns
- Some brushes react differently to fast vs. slow movements

## Pro Tips

- **Layer different brushes** - Use multiple brush types in one artwork
- **Combine with other tools** - Use brushes, then add lines or shapes
- **Experiment with colors** - Change colors between brush strokes
- **Listen to the sounds** - Each brush has unique audio feedback
- **Save your favorites** - Remember which brushes work well together

## Troubleshooting

- **Brush not working**: Make sure you've selected a brush from the submenu first
- **Effect too small**: Try holding Shift while drawing
- **Want to start over**: Use the Undo Guy or clear the canvas with the Moving Van
