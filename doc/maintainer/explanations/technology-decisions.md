```

## Architecture Patterns

### Component-Based Architecture

**Decision:** Organize code into reusable React components.

**Structure:**

```
src/
├── components/       # Reusable UI components
│   ├── Canvas/      # Canvas-related components
│   ├── Tools/       # Drawing tool components
│   └── UI/          # Generic UI components
├── hooks/           # Custom React hooks
├── utils/           # Pure utility functions
├── types/           # TypeScript type definitions
└── context/         # Global state management
```

**Rationale:**

- **Reusability**: Components can be reused across different parts of the app
- **Testability**: Individual components are easy to test in isolation
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new tools and features

### Custom Hooks Pattern

**Decision:** Extract canvas and drawing logic into custom hooks.

**Example:**

```typescript
const useCanvas = ({ width, height }) => {
  const canvasRef = useRef<HTMLCanvasElement>(null);
  const draw = useCallback((x, y) => {
    /* drawing logic */
  }, []);
  return { canvasRef, draw };
};
```

**Rationale:**

- **Separation of Concerns**: Business logic separated from UI rendering
- **Reusability**: Hooks can be shared between components
- **Testability**: Hooks can be tested independently
- **React Patterns**: Follows React best practices

### Context for Global State

**Decision:** Use React Context for application-wide state management.

**Rationale:**

- **Simplicity**: No need for external state management library yet
- **React Native**: Built-in React pattern
- **Typed**: TypeScript provides type safety for state
- **Scalable**: Can migrate to Redux/Zustand if needed

**State Structure:**

```typescript
interface AppState {
  currentTool: string;
  currentColor: string;
  canvasLayers: Layer[];
  isDrawing: boolean;
}
```

## Canvas Architecture

### Multi-Layer Canvas System

**Decision:** Maintain the original multi-layer canvas approach.

**Layers:**

- **Main Canvas**: Final rendered artwork
- **Temporary Canvas**: Current drawing operation
- **Preview Canvas**: Tool previews and temporary effects
- **Animation Canvas**: Animated effects
- **Background Canvas**: Background image manipulation

**Rationale:**

- **Performance**: Separate layers prevent unnecessary redraws
- **Compatibility**: Maintains behavior of original Kid Pix
- **Flexibility**: Different layers can have different rendering strategies
- **Undo/Redo**: Easier to implement with layer separation

**Implementation:**

```typescript
const useCanvasLayers = () => {
  const mainCanvasRef = useRef<HTMLCanvasElement>(null);
  const tempCanvasRef = useRef<HTMLCanvasElement>(null);
  const previewCanvasRef = useRef<HTMLCanvasElement>(null);

  // Layer management logic
};
```

### Drawing Tool Architecture

**Decision:** Maintain the three-method pattern from original Kid Pix.

**Pattern:**

```typescript
interface DrawingTool {
  onMouseDown: (event: MouseEvent) => void;
  onMouseMove: (event: MouseEvent) => void;
  onMouseUp: (event: MouseEvent) => void;
}
```

**Rationale:**

- **Consistency**: All tools follow the same interface
- **Compatibility**: Easier to port existing tools
- **Predictability**: Developers know what to expect from each tool
- **Event Handling**: Maps naturally to mouse/touch events

## Asset Management

### Static Assets Strategy

**Decision:** Keep original asset structure in `src/assets/`.

**Structure:**

```
src/assets/
├── img/             # Images (sprites, cursors, UI elements)
├── snd/             # Audio files (WAV format)
├── sndmp3/          # Audio files (MP3 format)
└── css/             # Legacy CSS files
```

**Rationale:**

- **Compatibility**: Maintains original file organization
- **Migration**: Easier to port existing assets
- **Formats**: Support both WAV and MP3 for browser compatibility
- **Performance**: Vite optimizes asset loading automatically

### Audio Strategy

**Decision:** Implement Web Audio API with fallbacks.

**Implementation:**

```typescript
class AudioManager {
  private audioContext: AudioContext;
  private sounds: Map<string, AudioBuffer>;

  async loadSound(name: string, url: string) {
    /* ... */
  }
  playSound(name: string) {
    /* ... */
  }
}
```

**Rationale:**

- **Performance**: Web Audio API provides better performance
- **Control**: More precise timing and audio manipulation
- **Compatibility**: Fallback to HTML5 Audio for older browsers
- **User Experience**: Respects browser autoplay policies

**Pipeline:**

1. **Lint**: ESLint and Prettier checks
2. **Test**: Unit tests with Vitest
3. **E2E**: Browser tests with Playwright
4. **Build**: Production build with Vite
5. **Deploy**: Automatic deployment to GitHub Pages

**Rationale:**

- **Integration**: Native GitHub integration
- **Cost**: Free for open source projects
- **Simplicity**: No external deployment services needed
- **Performance**: Fast build and deployment times

**Configuration:**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
```

### Environment Configuration

**Decision:** Use environment-based configuration for different deployment targets.

**Configuration:**

```typescript
// vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  base: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" ? "/kidpix/" : "/",
});
```

**Rationale:**

- **Flexibility**: Same codebase works in different environments
- **GitHub Pages**: Handles subdirectory deployment automatically
- **Local Development**: Works seamlessly in local environment

## Migration Strategy
