## Project Overview

This comprehensive migration plan transforms the KidPix modular JavaScript codebase into a modern React + TypeScript application following industry best practices. The migration is designed as both an implementation roadmap and a learning journey for developers new to modern web development technologies.

### Current State

- **Technology**: Modular JavaScript (ES5/ES6) with global namespaces
- **Architecture**: Event-driven with 5-layer canvas system
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development server
- **Structure**: 28 drawing tools, brush generators, texture systems

### Target State

- **Technology**: React 18+ with TypeScript 5+
- **Architecture**: Component-based with hooks and context
- **Testing**: Unit tests (Vitest), E2E tests (Playwright), 85%+ coverage
- **Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, pre-commit hooks, CI/CD pipeline

## Migration Strategy

### Gradual Transformation Approach

We use the **Strangler Fig Pattern** - gradually replacing parts of the old system while keeping it functional. This allows:

- Continuous deployment and testing
- Risk mitigation through incremental changes
- Learning opportunities at each step
- Rollback capabilities if issues arise

### Key Principles

1. **Behavior Preservation**: Maintain exact functionality and user experience
2. **Test-Driven Migration**: Write tests before converting code
3. **Educational Focus**: Each step includes learning materials
4. **Performance Monitoring**: No regression in drawing responsiveness

## Learning Objectives

By completing this migration, you'll gain hands-on experience with:

### Frontend Technologies

- **React**: Component lifecycle, hooks, context, event handling
- **TypeScript**: Type safety, interfaces, generics, declaration files
- **Modern JavaScript**: ES6+ features, modules, async/await

### Development Tools

- **Vite**: Modern build tool and development server
- **ESLint & Prettier**: Code quality and formatting
- **Git Hooks**: Automated quality checks

### Testing & Quality

- **Vitest**: Unit testing framework
- **Playwright**: End-to-end testing
- **Code Coverage**: Measuring test effectiveness
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing and deployment

### Architecture Patterns

- **Component Design**: Reusable, composable UI elements
- **State Management**: Context API, custom hooks
- **Event Systems**: Modern event handling patterns
- **Canvas Programming**: HTML5 Canvas with React

## Phase Documentation

### [Phase 1: Foundation & Tooling](./phase-1-foundation-and-tooling.md) (Weeks 1-2)

Set up modern development environment with linting, formatting, and testing infrastructure.

**Key Learning**: Development tooling, code quality automation, testing setup

### [Phase 2: Add TypeScript Declarations](./phase-2-add-typescript-declarations.md) (Weeks 3-4)

Introduce type safety without changing runtime behavior through declaration files.

**Key Learning**: TypeScript basics, type definitions, gradual typing

### [Phase 3: Core Architecture](./phase-3-core-architecture.md) (Weeks 5-8)

Establish React foundation with state management and canvas system.

**Key Learning**: React fundamentals, hooks, context API, canvas integration

### [Phase 4: Tool Migration](./phase-4-tool-migration.md) (Weeks 9-16)

Convert drawing tools one by one to React components with full test coverage.

**Key Learning**: Component design, event handling, testing strategies

### [Phase 5: Advanced Features](./phase-5-advanced-features.md) (Weeks 17-20)

Migrate complex systems like brushes, textures, and audio.

**Key Learning**: Advanced React patterns, performance optimization

### [Phase 6: Polish & Optimization](./phase-6-polish-optimization.md) (Weeks 21-24)

Add modern web features and optimize for production.

**Key Learning**: PWA development, accessibility, performance monitoring

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics

- **Code Coverage**: >85% for all new TypeScript code
- **Performance**: Canvas operations remain <16ms (60fps)
- **Bundle Size**: <2MB initial load, code splitting implemented
- **Type Safety**: 100% TypeScript strict mode compliance

### Quality Metrics

- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Cross-browser**: Works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Mobile Support**: Touch events fully functional
- **User Experience**: No behavioral changes from original

### Development Metrics

- **Build Time**: <30 seconds for full build
- **Test Suite**: <5 minutes for complete test run
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: <10 minutes from commit to deployment

## Getting Started

1. Read through all phase documentation to understand the full scope
2. Set up a learning environment by following Phase 1
3. Complete each phase sequentially, referring to background sections
4. Practice concepts in isolation before applying to KidPix codebase
5. Use the cross-references to connect concepts across phases

Each phase builds upon previous knowledge, so it's important to complete them in order. The background sections provide deep context, while the implementation steps give practical experience.
