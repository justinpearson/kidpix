Feature: fix browser console errors.

In a previous PR ( "Add AI tooling to take screenshots and view browser
console #23", https://github.com/justinpearson/kidpix/pull/23 ) we added the
ability for an AI agent to view the app's browser console while a human uses
the app (on the local dev server).

Now I want to use that functionality to do a quick smoke-test of the app,
fixing any browser console errors that arise while I click around.

The goal is to address glaring bugs, to get the app to a usable and deployable
state.

Specifically, we're going to have the agent start the dev server, then I will
click around and see what breaks, and ask the agent to fix it. Repeat until
the app has no browser errors and basically works.

Ready?
