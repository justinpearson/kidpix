# Feature: Build app using original source files in js/, instead of monolithic app.js

To familiarize yourself with this project, please read the following
`README.md` and any docs it references, especially these:

- CLAUDE.md -- our workflow process.
- CLAUDE-OLD-PROJ.md -- architecture of previous JS-only version of this app
  (may help understand original JS files).
- doc/doc-philosophy.md -- how I like to structure our technical
  documentation.
- doc/* -- tech docs for User and Maintainers.

Feature description: As a software developer in this codebase, I can easily
add features by editing the modular JS files in the js/ dir, rather than
editing the large, unwieldy, monolithic JS file js/app.js. The app is built
from the modular JS files, rather than app.js.
