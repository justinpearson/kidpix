# Feature request: Implement "Phase 3" of our React/Typescript migration.

Read these two docs:

- doc/maintainer/explanations/js-to-react-ts-migration/overview.md
- doc/maintainer/explanations/js-to-react-ts-migration/phase-3-core-architecture.md

Then implement phase-3-core-architecture.md .

Don't forget:

1. explain and propose your next actions to me. Remember, this is an educational exercise for me, so I want to be able to talk with you about what you're about to do and ask questions about it.

2. make intermediate commits.

Let's go!
