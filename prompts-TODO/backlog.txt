# Bug: Docs button has wrong link

The "docs" button in lower-left of screen (under the github icon) incorrectly links to https://justinpearson.github.io/docs/ but it should be https://justinpearson.github.io/kidpix/docs/ .


# Feature: Rename flood to paint-can.

Description: The "Paint Can" tool is named "Flood" in the code (eg, KiddoPaint.Tools.Flood). Let's make the code match the UI by renaming the flood-based terms to paint-can everywhere in the code: PaintCan, paint_can, etc. When we're done, there should be no "flood" in the codebase. Let's start by finding all instances of "flood" and drafting a plan for how to rename these instances.



# Feature: Remember last tool, subtool(s), color, color palette

Description: basically, the current UI state should persist between page-reloads, to achieve the following user-friendly niceties:

1. page-reload shouldn't change the selected tool, subtools, color, & color palette.
2. each tool should remember the "current" sub-tool(s) (ie, the last sub-tool(s) that were selected of that tool), and enable those sub-tool(s) when i click back to the tool.
3. Note that different tools can have differnt indexes of "last sub-tool(s) used". The design must remember "last sub-tool(s) used" for EACH tool. 

Not sure how best to implement this -- save this UI state to local browser storage?
