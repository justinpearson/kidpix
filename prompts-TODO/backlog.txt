- Remove most modifier keys
  - Review the code to see how modifier keys like SHIFT, CTRL, META, ALT are used.
  - For simplicity for small children, I feel that most of the modifier-key functionality should be removed.
  - but for circle, i like:
    - no modifier keys: 2 pts are opposite sides of circle
    - shift: first click is center of circle
    - ctrl: can draw ellipse, not just circle.
  - should have same for square:
    - no mod key: 2 pts are opposite corners of rect
    - shift: first click is center of rect, 2nd pt is a corner
    - ctrl: draw a square, not a rect.
      - currently, holding 'shift' achieves this. just move that logic to happen when 'ctrl' is held, not 'shift'. 
  - line: maybe we should have some mod key to snap to 45-deg angles, or smt.




- Remember last tool, subtool, color
  - save last selected color palette & color, load on page-load time.
  - save last selected tool, load on page-load time.
  - each tool should remember the last sub-tool(s) that were selected, and load them when you click on the tool.




- Add color picker
  - to make it easier to match colors, add a little eyedropper color picker under the color palette left-bar.
