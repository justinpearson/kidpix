- The "Paint Can" tool is named "Flood" in the code (eg, KiddoPaint.Tools.Flood). Let's make the code match the UI by renaming the flood-based terms to paint-can everywhere in the code. When we're done, there should be no "flood" in the codebase. Let's start by finding all instances of "flood" and drafting a plan for how to rename these instances.



- Consider what to do with modifier keys

  - For simplicity for small children, I feel that most of the modifier-key functionality should be removed.
  - Maybe also remove keyboard shortcuts too, see kiddopaint.js line 200 "document.onkeydown = function checkKey(e) { ..."
  - Review the code to see how modifier keys like SHIFT, CTRL, META, ALT are used.
  - but for circle, i like:
    - no modifier keys: 2 pts are opposite sides of circle
    - shift: first click is center of circle
    - ctrl: can draw ellipse, not just circle.
  - should have same for square:
    - no mod key: 2 pts are opposite corners of rect
    - shift: first click is center of rect, 2nd pt is a corner
    - ctrl: draw a square, not a rect.
      - currently, holding 'shift' achieves this. just move that logic to happen when 'ctrl' is held, not 'shift'. 
  - line: maybe we should have some mod key to snap to 45-deg angles, or smt.

  - options:
    - remove all code that checks modifiedCtrl etc -- kind of a shame to lose some of those cute features / options
    - disable all keyboard shortcuts for now, at a high level, can consider adding them back later.

  4. Sprite placer: 3x size multiplier when placing sprites5. Square tool: Disables stroke outline (fill only)
  6. Circle tool: Disables stroke outline (fill only)
  7. Astroid tool: Alternating colors between current and alt color
  8. 3D tool: Changes texture to speckles
  9. Texture (Stripes): Changes stripe pattern dimensions
  10. Whole canvas dither effect: Uses Bayer dithering with threshold
  11. Cut/Truck tool: Uses command range for size scaling
  12. Stamp tool: Uses command range for hue shifting



  Functions triggered by Control key (keyCode 17) on macOS:

  - Scribble tool: Increases jitter from 10 to 25

  Advanced Tools:

  TODO: investigate usage of shift & alt/option





- Remember last tool, subtool, color
  - save last selected color palette & color, load on page-load time.
  - save last selected tool, load on page-load time.
  - each tool should remember the last sub-tool(s) that were selected, and load them when you click on the tool.




- Add color picker
  - to make it easier to match colors, add a little eyedropper color picker under the color palette left-bar.
