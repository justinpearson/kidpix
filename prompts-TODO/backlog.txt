# Feature: Remember last tool, subtool(s), color, color palette

Description: basically, the current UI state should persist between page-reloads, to achieve the following user-friendly niceties:

1. page-reload shouldn't change the selected tool, subtools, color, & color palette.
2. each tool should remember the "current" sub-tool(s) (ie, the last sub-tool(s) that were selected of that tool), and enable those sub-tool(s) when i click back to the tool.
3. Note that different tools can have differnt indexes of "last sub-tool(s) used". The design must remember "last sub-tool(s) used" for EACH tool. 

Not sure how best to implement this -- save this UI state to local browser storage?
