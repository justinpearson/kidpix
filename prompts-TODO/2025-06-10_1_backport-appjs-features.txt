# New feature: port app.js's changes back to its original source JS files

To familiarize yourself with this project, please read `README.md` and any docs it references.

The original JS implementation is in:

- js/brushes/*
- js/builders/*
- etc.

Read CLAUDE-OLD-PROJ.md to inform your understanding of the original architecture.

Now for the feature request.

The file js/app.js is basically a concatenation of the other JS files in the js/ directory, but with a few features that I added on top. Now I would like to "back-port" those features back to the original JS files, for consistency. Long-term, this will allow us to remove app.js and build the app using the source JS files in the js/ dir.

Here's my proposal for how we will transfer my edits / features from app.js back to the original source JS files in the js/ dir:

Use the git history of js/app.js to see the edits I made to it, and make corresponding edits to the original source JS files, in the same chronological order.

For example, the first git commit with a real feature added to js/app.js is commit SHA 3a5437a1f20afb2dd29c7d5fff55676b21e89b97, titled "Add multi-undo, removing any redo capability". Its 'git show' shows this diff:

```
$ git show 3a5437a1f20afb2dd29c7d5fff55676b21e89b97

diff --git a/js/app.js b/js/app.js
index 301eafe..f9f3786 100644
--- a/js/app.js
+++ b/js/app.js

     document.getElementById("undo").addEventListener("mousedown", function () {
         KiddoPaint.Sounds.mainmenu();
         KiddoPaint.Sounds.oops();
-        KiddoPaint.Display.undo(!KiddoPaint.Current.modifiedAlt);
+        KiddoPaint.Display.undo(); // holding opt makes undo button not work; remove modifier
     });

...
```

Using `git grep` to search for a line from this diff, I see that code originated from `init/kiddopaint.js`:

```
% git grep 'document.getElementById("undo").addEventListener("mousedown"'
init/kiddopaint.js:    document.getElementById("undo").addEventListener("mousedown", function () {
```

Therefore I would then modify the corresponding lines of `init/kiddopaint.js`.

I'd then repeat this process with the other hunks of the diff, applying the changes from app.js back to its original JS files.

Then I'd commit those changes to the original JS files, using basically the same git commit message, with a pointer to the original commit SHA. Then I'd move on to the next git commit in app.js's git log, repeating this process.

That's the method I'd propose, to transfer my edits from app.js back to its original source JS files.

Does this make sense? If so, let's get started!
