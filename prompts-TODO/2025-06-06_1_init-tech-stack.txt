Hello. To familiarize yourself with this project, please read the following `README.md` and any docs it references (in this repo).

Now, we will set up this project.

Please ensure the following tech stack is set up:

- vite + yarn for project scaffolding, package management, and development
- git version control, with logically-separated commits, that uses the "Conventional Commits" spec
- github for PRs (use gh GitHub CLI)
- deployment via github actions and hosted on github pages
- jest + playwright for unit and browser-based integration tests, run automatically via github actions
