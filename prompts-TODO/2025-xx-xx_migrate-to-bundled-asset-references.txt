Feature: After converstion to ES modules / ReactTS, use "bundled asset references" instead of hardcoded asset paths.

> tell me about using "bundled asset references"

⏺ Bundled Asset References

  This approach involves letting Vite handle asset management by importing assets into your JavaScript, rather than using hardcoded paths.

  How It Works

  Instead of hardcoded paths, you import assets as modules:

  // Traditional hardcoded approach (what you have now)
  var toolIcon = "/src/assets/img/tool-pencil.png";

  // Bundled asset reference approach
  import toolIconUrl from '/src/assets/img/tool-pencil.png';
  var toolIcon = toolIconUrl;

  Benefits

  1. Automatic path resolution - Vite handles dev vs production paths
  2. Asset optimization - Images get optimized, renamed with hashes
  3. Dead code elimination - Unused assets aren't bundled
  4. Cache busting - Hash-based filenames for better caching

  The Challenge for Your Project

  Your codebase uses modular JavaScript loaded via script tags, not ES modules with imports. This means you can't directly use import statements in your current JS
  files.

  Possible Solutions

  1. Hybrid approach: Create an asset manifest file that maps logical names to bundled URLs:
  // assets-manifest.js (generated by Vite)
  window.ASSETS = {
    'tool-pencil': '/assets/tool-pencil-abc123.png',
    'sound-pencil': '/assets/pencil-sound-def456.mp3'
  };
  2. Convert to ES modules: Migrate your script tags to use ES module imports (bigger architectural change)
  3. Asset plugin: Use a Vite plugin to generate asset URLs and inject them into your JS files at build time

  For your current architecture, relative paths (Option 2 from before) would be much simpler to implement than bundled references.

  Would you like me to search for the hardcoded paths in your JS files to see the scope of changes needed?

> ok. as you suggested, let's explore using relative paths. But I'll make a note to consider using bundled references once we finishg the migration to React/TS.
