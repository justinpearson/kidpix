# Set up current best-practices tech stack

(To familiarize yourself with this project, please read the following `README.md` and any docs it references.)

Now that we've removed my previous failed React implementation, let's set up a modern tech stack.

Please ensure the following tech stack is set up:

- documentation -- please read doc/doc-philosophy.md to inform how you create & update docs
- vite + yarn for project scaffolding, package management, and development
- typescript protection
- eslint linter setup, installed as pre-commit check (use "husky" tool?)
- git version control, with logically-separated commits, that uses the "Conventional Commits" spec
	- (this is specified in .cursor/rules/*, did you read those files?)
- github for PRs (use gh GitHub CLI)
- deployment via github actions and hosted on github pages
- jest + playwright for unit and browser-based integration tests, run automatically via github actions
