# Migration part 1: use original JS files in modern React app context

(To familiarize yourself with this project, please read the following
`README.md` and any docs it references.)

Now that we have a modern tech stack setup, we can begin to migrate the
plain-JS KidPix app to our new tech stack.

The original JS implementation is in:

- js/brushes/*
- js/builders/*
- etc.

Let's see if we can get the original app ported to React. First read
CLAUDE-OLD-PROJ.md to inform your understanding of the original architecture.
Then configure our current React / Typescript project to use these old JS
files, in such a way so that I can view my existing app
(index.html -> kidpix.html -> js/app.js), but ALSO the "original" KidPix app
that is powered by the JS files in the js/ directory (except for js/app.js).

For example, one approach would be:

1. somehow configure the project to build the js/*.js files (EXCEPT FOR js/app.js, see below)
2. create a new file kidpix-orig.html that uses those js/*.js files
3. in index.html, add a new link that points to kidpix-orig.html

(Happy to hear other ideas if you have them!)

IMPORTANT: do not modify the file `js/app.js`. That powers the current KidPix
app (kidpix.html). It is basically a concatenation of all the `js/*` javascript files, BUT
ALSO CONTAINS MY OWN FEATURES. (Unfortunately, for expediency, I have
implemented several features in app.js which are not reflected in the
original JS files.) DO NOT MODIFY app.js!!
