New feature: Make Undo / Redo work across page reloads

Git branch: undo-across-page-reloads

If I draw a line, then reload the page, then click undo, it should undo the line.

However, when I do that currently, it doesn't undo the line, and the browser console says:

```
display.js:154 undo buffer empty, nothing to do
```

I think we store the previous canvases in browser local-storage, which I'm assuming persists across page reloads, is that right? If so, maybe we simply need to store some additional state about the undo/redo pointer.

Thoughts?
