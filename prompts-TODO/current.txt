# Feature: Remember last tool, subtool(s), color, color palette

Git branch: remember-last-tool

Description: The current UI state should persist between page-reloads, for a friendlier & seamless user experience across page-reloads.

Specifically:

Scenario 1. Undo and redo work across page reloads
  Given I have drawn a line
  When I reload the page
  And I click undo
  Then the line should be undone

Scenario 2. Selected tool, subtools, color, and palette persist across page reloads
  Given I have selected the Brush tool with the Tree subtool
  And I have selected the first color palette (index 0)
  And I have selected the last color in the palette (brown)
  When I reload the page
  Then those selections should still be active
  And the defaults (Pencil tool, thickness 0, first color palette, black color) should not be active

Scenario 3. Tool remembers the last selected subtools
  Given I select the Pencil tool with Thickness 10 and Rainbow texture
  And I select the Brush tool with the Tree subtool
  When I switch back to the Pencil tool
  Then the Pencil tool's subtools should still be Thickness 10 and Rainbow texture
  When I switch to the Brush tool
  Then the Brush tool's subtool should still be Tree


Implementation Note: 

1. Use test-driven development (TDD) for this, writing an e2e test for each scenario.

2. Different tools can have differnt indexes of "last sub-tool(s) used". The design must remember "last sub-tool(s) used" for EACH tool. 

3. Not sure how best to implement this -- save this UI state to local browser storage?
