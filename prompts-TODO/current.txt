# Feature: Support github releases

Git branch: support-github-releases

Description: Add yarn commands and a github workflow that creates a github "release" of the dist/ directory tarball, so that users can easily download and run the built app.

One simple way would be to add the dist/ directory to git, but that seems like poor practice. So I'm wondering if github's "releases" feature offers a way to host a zipfile of the dist/ directory?

What are our options for distributing "releases" of the kidpix app? (I don't even know really what a "release" is.)

‚è∫ GitHub releases are perfect for distributing built applications! Here are your options:

  GitHub Releases (Recommended)

  GitHub releases let you:
  - Create a tagged version of your code (e.g., v1.0.0)
  - Attach up to 1000 files per release (each under 2GB)
  - Provide a zip of your dist/ folder for easy download
  - Include release notes describing changes
  - Notify users when new versions are available

  Workflow:
  1. Build your app (yarn build creates dist/)
  2. Zip the dist/ folder locally
  3. Create a release on GitHub and attach the zip
  4. Users download the zip and open index.html in a browser

  Other Distribution Options

  - GitHub Pages: Host the built app live at username.github.io/repo-name
  - Netlify/Vercel: Free hosting with automatic builds from your repo
  - NPM package: If you want to distribute as a library
  - Electron: Package as a desktop app

  Automated Release Workflow

  You could automate this with GitHub Actions:
  - Trigger on tag push (e.g., git tag v1.0.0 && git push --tags)
  - Build the app
  - Create release with built files automatically attached

  Would you like me to help you create your first release with a zipped dist/ folder, or set up automated releases?
